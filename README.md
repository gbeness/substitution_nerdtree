# substitution_menuitem

Based on a similar plug-in for greping on nerdtree folders (https://gist.github.com/scrooloose/205807).

This plug-in lets you do a find and replace on a folder without leaving vim.  Simply press 'm' on the 
folder you want in nerdtree to bring up the nerdtree menu, and a new option will be there, the 's'ubstitute
option, which will then prompt you for the find text and replace text.
